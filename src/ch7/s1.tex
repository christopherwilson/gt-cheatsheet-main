\wde{7.1.2} Let $G$ be a group. A \emph{composition series} for $G$ is a chain of subgroups $\{e\} = G_0 \norm G_1 \norm \ldots \norm G_{s-1} \norm G_s = G$ where $G_i \ne G_{i+1}$ and $G_{i+1}/G_i$ is simple for all $i$.
\wt{7.1.3 Camille Jordan 1869, Otto H\"older 1889} Let $G$ be a finite group. Then $G$ has a composition series. Moreover, any two composition series have the same composition length, and they have the same composition factors up to isomorphism of groups and order of the factors. 
\wt{7.1.4} Let $F$ be a finite simple group. Then $G$ is isomorphic to one of: Family 1 ($C_p$ for prime $p$); Family 2 ($A_n$ for $n \ge 5$); 16 other infinite families; 26 sporadic groups.
