\wpr{$D_n$ Free Group} For any $n \ge 3$ we have $D_n \cong \cyc{a, c |a^2, c^2, (ac)^n}$.
\wpf{} Let $G = \cyc{a, c |a^2, c^2, (ac)^n}$. Let $b = ac$, then $(ab)^2 = e$ and so $ba = ab^{-1} = ab^{n-1}$. Thus, show that $G = \{a^ib^j\}$, where $i \in \{0,1\}$, $j \in \{0, \ldots, n-1\}$. Thus, $|G| \le 2n$. Let $g \in D_5$ be a rotation by $2\pi/n$ and let $h$ be any reflection. Note that $hg$ is also a reflection. Thus we have $h^2 = (hg)^2 = g^n = e$. By the universal property of free groups, there are surjective homomorphisms: $\psi:\cyc{A,C} \to D_5;\ A \mapsto h;\ C \mapsto hg$ and $\pi: \cyc{A,C} \to G; A \mapsto a; C \mapsto c.$ We have $\psi(A^2) = \psi(C^2) = e.$ Further, $\psi((AC)^n) = (hhg)^n = e.$ As $\ker\pi$ consists of the elemeents that are sent ot $e$ as logical consequences of mapping $A^2$, $C^2$, and $(AC)^n$ to $e$, we have $\ker \pi \subseteq \ker \psi.$ Thus, by the universal property of factor groups, there is a surjective homomorphism $\Bar{\psi}: G \to D_n$ with $\Bar{\psi}\pi = \psi$. Thus, $|G| \ge |D_n| = 2n.$ Since we saw earlier that $|G| \le 2n$ we have $|G| = 2n$. As $\Bar{\psi}$ is surjective, it is bijective and therefore a group isomorphism.
