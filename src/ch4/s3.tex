\wl{4.3.1} Let $p$ be a prime and let $G$ be a finite $p$-group acting on a finite set $X$. Then the number of fixed points in $X$ is congruent to $|X|$ modulo $p$.
\wc{4.3.2} Let $|G| = p^m r$, with $p$ not dividing $r$. Let $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. Then $P \norm G \iff P$ is the unique Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ (i.e. $n_p = 1$).
\wde{4.3.3 Normaliser} Let $G$ be a group and $H \le G$. The \textit{normaliser} of $H$ is $N_G(H) = \{g \in G\ :\ gHg^{-1} = H\}$.
\wl{4.3.4} Let $G$ be a finite group. 
(a) For any subgroup $H \le G$, we have $[G : N_G(H)] =$ the number of distinct conjugates of $H$. 
(b) Let $p |\ |G|$ and let $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. Then $n_p = [G:N_G (P)]$.
