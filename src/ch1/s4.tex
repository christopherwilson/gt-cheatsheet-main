\wde{1.4.1 Group Homomorphism} Let $G, H$ be groups. A function $\phi : G \to H$ s.t. $\phi(ab) = \phi(a)\phi(b)\ \forall\ a,b \in G$  is a \textit{group homomorphism}.
\wde{1.4.3 Group Isomorphism} If $G,H$ are groups and $\psi: G \to H$ is a bijective group homomorphism, $\psi$ is a \textit{group isomorphism} and $G$ and $H$ are \textit{isomorphic}, written $G \cong H$.
\wde{1.4.5 Kernel} Let $\phi : G \to H$ be a group homomorphism. The \textit{kernel} of $\phi$, $\ker{\phi}$, is $\{g \in G : \phi(g) = e\}$.
\wde{1.4.6 Automorphism Group} Let $G$ be a group. The set of all isomorphism $\phi: G \to G$ is also a group called the \textit{automorphism group of $G$}, written $\Aut(G)$. The group operation is function comopostion.
