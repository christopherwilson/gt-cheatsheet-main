\wde{9.1.2 Field Extension, Algebraic} If $K$ and $L$ are fields such that $K$ is a subfield of $L$, we call $L$ a \emph{field extension} of $K$ and we denote an extension $L/K$. A field extension $L/K$ is called \emph{algebraic} if every element of $L$ is a root of a non-zero polynomial with coefficients in $K$.
\wl{9.1.4} If $L/K$ and $K/F$ are field extensions, $[L:K]\cdot[K:F] = [L:F]$.
\wl{9.1.5} If $L/K$ is a finite extension, then it is algebraic.
